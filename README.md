# API-Security-Checklist
Checklist of the most important security countermeasures when designing, testing, and releasing your API.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## AUTHENTICATION
- [ ] Don't use `Basic Auth` Use standard authentication (e.g. JWT , OAuth).
- [ ] Don't reinvent the wheel in `Authentication`, `token generating`, `password storing` use the standards.

## AUTHENTICATION : JWT (JSON WEB TOKEN)
- [ ] Use random complicated key (`JWT Secret`) to make brute forcing token very hard.
- [ ] Don't extract the algorithm from the payload. Force algorithm in the backend (`HS256` or `RS256`). 
- [ ] Make token expiration (`TTL`, `RTTL`) short as possible.
- [ ] Don't store sensitive data in the JWT payload, it can be decoded easily.


## AUTHENTICATION : OAUTH
- [ ] Always validate `redirect_uri` on server side to allow only whitelisted urls.
- [ ] Always try to exchange for code not tokens (don't allow `response_type=token`).
- [ ] Use `state` parameter with random hash to prevent CSRF on OAuth authentication process.
- [ ] Define default scope , and validate scope parameter for each application. 


## ACCESS
- [ ] Limit requests (Throttling) to avoid DDoS / Bruteforce attacks.
- [ ] Use HTTPS on server side to avoid MITM.
- [ ] Use `HSTS` header with SSL to avoid SSL Strip attack.

## INPUT 
- [ ] Use proper HTTP method according to operation , `GET (read)`, `POST (create)`, `PUT (replace/update)` and `DELETE (to delete a record)`.
- [ ] Validate `content-type` on request Accept header ( Content Negotiation ) to allow only your supported format (e.g. `application/xml` , `application/json` ... etc) and respond with `406 Not Acceptable` response if not matched.
- [ ] Validate `content-type` of posted data as you accept (e.g. `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` , `multipart/form-data ,application/json` ... etc ).
- [ ] Validate User input to avoid common vulnerabilities (e.g. `XSS`, `SQL-Injection` , `Remote Code Execution` ... etc).
- [ ] Don't use any sensitive data ( `credentials` , `Passwords`, `security tokens`, or `API keys`) in the URL, but use standard Authorization header.

## PROCESSING
- [ ] Check if all endpoint protected behind the authentication to avoid broken authentication.
- [ ] User own resource id should be avoided. Use `/me/orders` instead of `/user/654321/orders`
- [ ] Don't use auto increment id's use `UUID` instead.
- [ ] If you are parsing XML files , make sure entity parsing is not enable to avoid `XXE`.
- [ ] Use CDN for file uploads.
- [ ] If you are dealing with huge amount of data , use Workers and Queues to return response fast to avoid HTTP Blocking. 
- [ ] Do not forget and leave the DEBUG mode on.


## OUTPUT
- [ ] Send `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header.
- [ ] Send `X-Frame-Options: deny` header.
- [ ] Force `content-type` for your response , if you return `application/json` then your response `content-type` is `application/json`.
- [ ] Don't return sensitive data like `credentials` , `Passwords`, `security tokens`.
- [ ] Return proper status code according to operation you done. (e.g. `200 OK` , `400 Bad Request` , `401 Unauthorized`, `405 Method Not Allowed` ... etc).
